An original 3D wrestling vertical slice (Godot 4.6, Forward+, Jolt), built
with the Gauntlet Loop pattern — builder/critic rounds judged against a
measured reference corpus.

The game ships fully original wrestlers, movesets, and branding. WWE 2K
footage is used only as a *measurement* reference (frame timings, camera
framing, HUD layout) — no extracted models, textures, audio, or likenesses
enter this repo.

## Layout

- `game/` — the Godot project. Core systems live in `game/core/`
  (`fsm/`, `grapple/`, `combat/`, `minigames/`, `camera/`, `replay/`,
  `capture/`); `game/resources/` holds the `MoveDef` tuning surface;
  `game/tests/` holds gdUnit4 tests.
- `gauntlet/anchor/ARCHITECTURE.md` — the contract gauntlet builders may
  not violate. Read this first.
- `gauntlet/refs/` — the reference corpus: measured timings, camera
  behavior, HUD layout, and feel, all traceable to footage under
  `gauntlet/refs/raw/` (gitignored — drop clips locally).
- `gauntlet/status/` — `slices.json` + the generated
  `gauntlet-status.html` tracking every gauntlet slice's round count,
  verdict, and current largest gap.
- `tools/capture/` — the capture harness driver (`run_capture.sh`), the
  evidence gate (`evidence_gate.py`) that must pass before any critic sees
  a capture, and the status-page generator.

## Current phase

**Phase 0 (anchor infrastructure)** is scaffolded: project skeleton, core
system stubs, replay/determinism plumbing, capture harness, evidence gate,
CI, and the architecture contract.

Still open before the gauntlet (Phase 4) can start:

- **Phase 1** — populate `gauntlet/refs/` from real WWE 2K (or WWF No
  Mercy emulator, as fallback) footage. Currently placeholder/pending.
- **Phase 2** — grey-box MVP: mechanically complete, visually ugly match.
- **Phase 3** — CC0 asset retargeting + paired grapple/reversal animation
  authoring in Blender.

See `gauntlet/anchor/ARCHITECTURE.md` for the full contract and
`gauntlet/refs/VISUAL_BAR.md` / `FEEL_BAR.md` for the anchor docs each
gauntlet round is judged against.
